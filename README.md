# Land Price Estimation using Spatial Feature Analysis

##  Overview
This project estimates the **land price** of a given location based on:  

- **Population density** from postal data.
- **Proximity & variety** of infrastructure such as buildings, education facilities, healthcare centers, railways, seaports, and waterways.
- **Dynamic price adjustments** depending on the availability and closeness of nearby amenities.

The system integrates multiple geospatial datasets, processes them in **GeoPandas**, and calculates a final estimated **price per square foot** for user-provided coordinates.  

## Dataset
Due to GitHub's file size restrictions, the datasets are hosted on Google Drive.
**[[Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sc0jxvsqtN614knBgj_k88whlsOUhh-m?usp=drive_link)]**

##  Features Implemented

### 1. **User Coordinate Input**
- Accepts latitude and longitude from the user  
- Finds the nearest postal record within **1 km**  

### 2. **Population Density–Based Base Price**
- High density → higher base price  
- Rural areas → lower base price  

### 3. **Spatial Feature Extraction** *(1 km radius)*
Counts and measures average distances to:  
-  Buildings  
-  Education facilities *(points & polygons)*  
-  Healthcare facilities *(points & polygons)*  
-  Railways *(points & lines)*  
-  Seaports *(points & polygons)*  
-  Waterways *(points, lines & polygons)*  

### 4. **Variety Score Calculation**
- Measures diversity of available categories near the point  

### 5. **Dynamic Price Adjustment**
- Increases price if amenities are **closer** or **more varied**  

### 6. **Final Output**
- Table of nearby feature counts and average distances  
- Variety score  
- Estimated **land price in ₹/sq.ft**

##  How It Works
1. Load all infrastructure datasets  
2. Ask user for coordinates  
3. Match with nearest postal record  
4. Extract surrounding features within **1 km buffer**  
5. Calculate price based on **density, proximity, and variety**  
6. Display result

## Beneficiaries of This Project

- This project is designed to assist a range of stakeholders:

- Urban Planners & Policy Makers: For evaluating regional disparities and planning infrastructure.

- Investors & Developers: To make more informed decisions before committing to land acquisition.

- Government Agencies: As a supportive tool for assessing growth corridors.

- Researchers & Academics: For studying land use patterns and economic development.

- General Public: To gain a transparent, approximate understanding of how various factors influence land prices.

**⚠️ Disclaimer: The estimated prices generated by this system are purely indicative and must not be considered as official or legally binding valuations.**

## Price Variability and Assumptions

- Land pricing is not static — it is highly dynamic and influenced by multiple economic, demographic, and regulatory factors. This project provides an estimated price for land parcels based on a combination of base assumptions, population density, and surrounding infrastructural features (such as airports, roads, railways, seaports, healthcare, and educational facilities).

**Base Price Assumptions**

- The project assumes a dynamic base price depending on the population density of a region (e.g., higher base values in dense urban centers vs. lower values in rural areas).

- This base price is not absolute and will vary in reality depending on local economic conditions, urban expansion, and government policies.

**Factors That Influence Variability**

- Infrastructural Development: Availability of nearby infrastructure (airports, railways, healthcare, education, etc.) directly affects accessibility and desirability of land, but these factors evolve with new projects and policy interventions.

- Population Density: Population growth or migration patterns can rapidly alter the land’s demand and, therefore, its price trajectory.

- Collector Rates (Government-set Prices): Each district has circle rates/collector rates that act as official benchmarks for property transactions. These are revised periodically and may differ significantly from market-driven values.

- Regulatory Changes: Zoning laws, land use permissions, and environmental clearances can either enhance or limit land usability, thereby influencing price.

- Economic Factors: Inflation, interest rates, and overall economic growth play a role in how land is valued in both short and long term.

**Theory Behind Land Pricing**

In principle, the value of land is determined by a mix of:

- Utility: How the land can be used (residential, commercial, agricultural, etc.)

- Scarcity: Availability of land in a region versus demand for it

- Location: Proximity to critical infrastructure, connectivity, and amenities

- Regulation: Government policies and official rates that influence market practices
